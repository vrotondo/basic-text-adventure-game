Discussion: Operators 
In this discussion, you will apply the Python programming concepts you've learned so far in this lesson. You will be focusing on conditional statements, user input handling, and basic game design. Your task is to create a simple text-based adventure game that demonstrates these skills. 

This discussion has two discussion posts: an initial post with your game design, and a response to your peers' game design. 

Instructions: Initial Post 
Create a Python script for a text-based adventure game where the player chooses to explore a forest, a cave, or a beach. Your script should:

Prompt the player to choose a location
Use conditional statements to handle the player's choice
Display a unique message for each location
Handle invalid inputs appropriately
Include the following in your post:

Your Python code in a code block
A brief explanation of your implementation choices
Any challenges you faced and their resolution
Instructions: Response to Peer
After posting your initial response and reviewing your peers' submissions, select one classmate's post, and choose one of the following areas to discuss:
How the code ensures that the player's input is valid.
What happens if the player enters a choice that is not one of the predefined options. 
How to expand the game to include more choices or more complex conditions.
Identify the area of your focus in your response. 
Be sure to provide detailed suggestions or questions about the code snippet included in your response.
